= Configuration, Installation, and Use of Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift

== Access Your Lab Environment

During this lab you will be instructed to ssh to your hypervisor at IP address {bastion_public_hostname}.
Use username `{bastion_ssh_user_name}` and password `{bastion_ssh_password}`.

Once logged in the hypervisor you can access to the bastion at IP address `192.168.123.100` as `root` using password `redhat`.

If needed, you can navigate to the OpenShift console URL: {ocp_console_url}[{ocp_console_url}^] using user `admin` and password `{ocp_admin_password}`

== Prerequisites for Installation

Some prerequisites needed to install Red Hat OpenStack Services on OpenShift (RHOSO) are already included in the lab environment such as:

* An operational OpenShift cluster which supports Multus CNI
* oc command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* k9s command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* podman command line tool on your workstation (bastion host)
* Access to repositories which contain the Dev Preview code
* Access to an existing registry or create a local Quay registry
* Example YAML files are available in this repository which can be cloned or copy and pasted for use.
For ease of instructions it will be assumed the repo has been cloned

=== OpenShift walkthrough

An operational OpenShift cluster which supports Multus CNI is already installed for your use.

There are three operators that are required by Red Hat OpenStack services on OpenShift, the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/networking/kubernetes-nmstate#installing-the-kubernetes-nmstate-operator-cli[NMState  Operator^] the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/networking/load-balancing-with-metallb#nw-metallb-installing-operator-cli_metallb-operator-install[MetalLB  Operator^]  and the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14///security/cert_manager_operator/cert-manager-operator-install.html[Cert-Manager + Operator^]

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes/OpenShift application. An OpenShift/Kubernetes application is both deployed on OpenShift/Kubernetes and managed using the OpenShift/Kubernetes APIs and oc or kubectl tooling. Operators implement and automate common tasks related to an application's lifecycle, such as deployment, scaling, and backup/restore, by extending Kubernetes's capabilities.

==== Accessing the Cluster

From the hypervisor, log in to the bastion

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
sudo -i
ssh root@192.168.123.100
----

Password is `redhat`.

.Sample Output
----
[root@ocp4-bastion ~]
----

Make sure you can reach out to the OpenShift cluster, for instance, by listing the nodes in your cluster:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get nodes
----

.Sample Output
----

==== NMState Operator

The NMState Operator in OpenShift is a Kubernetes Operator that provides a declarative way to manage node network configurations across an OpenShift cluster. It utilizes the Node Network Configuration Policy (NNCP) to drive the desired network state across cluster nodes, leveraging the NMState project under the hood. It's mainly used when configuring OpenShift nodes to configure network isolation for the OpenStack services networks. It can also very used to configure networking in the Compute Nodes. 

Verify that NMstate pods are up and running by entering the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openshift-nmstate
----

.Sample Output
----

==== MetalLB Operator

MetalLB is a load balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, providing a network load balancing solution that integrates with standard network equipment. In environments where external load balancers like those provided by cloud providers (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer, etc.) are unavailable, MetalLB fills that gap by offering load-balancing services.

In RHOSO, we use the L2 layer mode. In this mode, MetalLB responds to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests for the IP address of the Service, essentially "claiming" the IP address on the local network. When a client sends traffic to that IP address, MetalLB forwards the traffic to one of the Service's Pods.

Verify that MetalLB pods are up and running by entering the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n metallb-system
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

==== Cert-Manager Operator

With cert-manager, a Kubernetes add-on automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates within Kubernetes clusters. It simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing, and using SSL/TLS certificates from various certificate authorities (CAs), including public ones like Let's Encrypt, as well as private CAs. cert-manager enables users to ensure their applications are securely served over HTTPS without manually managing certificate lifecycles. We use cert-manager in RHOSO to issue and manage the SSL/TLS certicates to enable SSL/TLS on the OpenStack endpoints, called TLS everywhere (TLS-e)

Verify that cert-manager pods are up and running by entering the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n cert-manager
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
